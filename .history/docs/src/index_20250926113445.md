# MeanFieldToolbox.jl

MeanFieldToolbox.jl is a Julia package meant for solving generalized self-consistent mean-field equations on a lattice.

Currently supported :
* Lattice implementation is done through [TightBindingToolbox.jl](https://github.com/Anjishnubose/TightBindingToolbox.jl). Any custom lattice in d=1,2,3 is supported.
* User can input any two-site interaction in the form of arrays, and their corresponding mean-field equations. Simple four-fermion interactions are already built in (such as Hubbard, Spin-Spin interactions etc.).
* Can track any hopping and pairing order parameters.
* Self-consistentcy solver is implemented using [FixedPointToolbox.jl](https://github.com/Anjishnubose/FixedPointToolbox.jl). Can customize the solver, the tolerance of convergence, the maximum number of iterations and so on.
* Can checkpoint and save results into JLD2 files, and resume iterations from reading such files.
* Can plot results of order parameters, and the mean-field ground state energy as a function of iterations.
